# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it
# will be replaced.
#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.

# Shell
#
# You can set `shell.program` to the path of your favorite shell, e.g.
# `/bin/fish`. Entries in `shell.args` are passed unmodified as arguments to the
# shell.
#
# Default:
#   - (macOS) /bin/bash --login
#   - (Linux/BSD) user login shell
#   - (Windows) powershell
shell:
  program: /usr/bin/tmux
  args:
    - new-session

# Bell
#
# The bell is rung every time the BEL control character is received.
#bell:
  # Visual Bell Animation
  #
  # Animation effect for flashing the screen when the visual bell is rung.
  #
  # Values for `animation`:
  #   - Ease
  #   - EaseOut
  #   - EaseOutSine
  #   - EaseOutQuad
  #   - EaseOutCubic
  #   - EaseOutQuart
  #   - EaseOutQuint
  #   - EaseOutExpo
  #   - EaseOutCirc
  #   - Linear
  #animation: EaseOutExpo

  # Duration of the visual bell flash in milliseconds. A `duration` of `0` will
  # disable the visual bell animation.
  #duration: 0

  # Visual bell animation color.
  #color: '#ffffff'

  # Bell Command
  #
  # This program is executed whenever the bell is rung.
  #
  # When set to `command: None`, no command will be executed.
  #
  # Example:
  #   command:
  #     program: notify-send
  #     args: ["Hello, World!"]
  #
  #command: None

#selection:
  # This string contains all characters that are used as separators for
  # "semantic words" in Alacritty.
  #semantic_escape_chars: ",│`|:\"' ()[]{}<>\t"

  # When set to `true`, selected text will be copied to the primary clipboard.
  #save_to_clipboard: false
 
# Live config reload (changes require restart)
#live_config_reload: true

# Startup directory
#
# Directory the shell is started in. If this is unset, or `None`, the working
# directory of the parent process will be used.
#working_directory: None

# Send ESC (\x1b) before characters when alt is pressed.
#alt_send_esc: true

# Offer IPC using `alacritty msg` (unix only)
#ipc_socket: true

# Regex hints
#
# Terminal hints can be used to find text in the visible part of the terminal
# and pipe it to other applications.
#hints:
  # Keys used for the hint labels.
  #alphabet: "jfkdls;ahgurieowpq"

  # List with all available hints
  #
  # Each hint must have a `regex` and either an `action` or a `command` field.
  # The fields `mouse`, `binding` and `post_processing` are optional.
  #
  # The fields `command`, `binding.key`, `binding.mods`, `binding.mode` and
  # `mouse.mods` accept the same values as they do in the `key_bindings` section.
  #
  # The `mouse.enabled` field controls if the hint should be underlined while
  # the mouse with all `mouse.mods` keys held or the vi mode cursor is above it.
  #
  # If the `post_processing` field is set to `true`, heuristics will be used to
  # shorten the match if there are characters likely not to be part of the hint
  # (e.g. a trailing `.`). This is most useful for URIs.
  #
  # Values for `action`:
  #   - Copy
  #       Copy the hint's text to the clipboard.
  #   - Paste
  #       Paste the hint's text to the terminal or search.
  #   - Select
  #       Select the hint's text.
  #   - MoveViModeCursor
  #       Move the vi mode cursor to the beginning of the hint.
